## üîç How to Verify Data is Loading

   - ‚úÖ No "Failed to fetch" messages
   - ‚úÖ Console logs showing data being loaded (if any)

### Step 2: Check Network Tab
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
4. Look for:
   - ‚úÖ Requests to `firestore.googleapis.com`
   - ‚úÖ Status 200 (success) responses
   - ‚úÖ Response data containing your properties/rent/payments

### Step 3: Visual Verification
1. **Dashboard:**
   - Should show numbers (not 0 or "N/A")
   - Should show recent payments if any exist
   - Statistics cards should have real data

2. **Properties Page:**

   - Should show statistics at the top

5. **Payments:**

   - Should show summary statistics

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If You See "No Data" or Empty Lists:

1. **Check if you're logged in as the correct user:**
   - Super Admin: Should see ALL data
   - Org Admin: Should see organization data
   - Property Manager: Should see only assigned properties

2. **Verify data exists in Firebase:**
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Navigate to Firestore Database
   - Check if collections have documents:
     - `properties` collection
     - `rent` collection
     - `payments` collection

3. **Check user permissions:**
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí `users` collection
   - Find your user document
   - Verify `roleId` is set correctly
   - Verify `permissions` array includes necessary permissions
   - Verify `organizationId` is set (if not super_admin)

4. **Check Firestore Rules:**
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules
   - Verify rules allow read access for your role
   - Rules should match `firestore-complete.rules`

### If You See Errors:

1. **"Permission Denied" Errors:**
   - Check Firestore rules
   - Verify user has correct role and permissions
   - Run `node scripts/bootstrapAdmin.js` to ensure admin user is set up

2. **"Index Required" Errors:**
   - Check browser console for the index creation link
   - Click the link to create the required index
   - Wait a few minutes for index to build
   - Refresh the page

3. **"Network Error" or "Failed to Fetch":**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Firebase project is active
   - Check Firebase Console for any service issues

## üìù Sample Data Script

If you need to add sample data to test:

```bash
node scripts/addSampleData.js
```

This will create:
- 2 sample properties (1 building, 1 land)
- 3 rent records
- 3 payment records

**Note:** The script will skip if data already exists to avoid duplicates.
