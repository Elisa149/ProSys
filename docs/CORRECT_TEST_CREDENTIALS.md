4. **Clear browser cache** if you experience login issues
5. **Logout and login again** after role changes to refresh permissions

---

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

### Can't Login?
1. Verify you copied the password exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Check if the account exists in Firebase Authentication
3. Try clearing browser cookies/cache
4. Check browser console for errors

### Wrong Sidebar Items?

2. Check user's document in Firestore `users` collection
3. Ensure `roleId` and `status: 'active'` are set correctly
4. Logout and login again to refresh

### Permission Errors?
1. Verify Firebase security rules are published
2. Check that user's `permissions` array matches their role
