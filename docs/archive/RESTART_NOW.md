# 🔄 RESTART REQUIRED - Do This Now!

## ⚠️ **Your browser has cached the old buggy code!**

The fix has been applied to the code, but your browser is still running the old version.

---

## 🚀 **Follow These Steps RIGHT NOW**

### **Step 1: Stop the Dev Server**

In your terminal where `yarn dev` is running:
- Press `Ctrl + C`
- Wait for it to stop completely

### **Step 2: Start Dev Server Again**

```bash
yarn dev
```

Wait for it to say:
```
VITE v4.5.0  ready in XXX ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### **Step 3: Hard Refresh Browser**

Do **BOTH** of these:

1. **Clear cache completely**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Hard refresh**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
   - Or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - Or just `Shift + F5`

### **Step 4: Test Login**

```
Email: superadmin@propertytest.com
Password: SuperAdmin123!
```

## ✅ **Expected Result After Restart**

- ✅ Login succeeds
- ✅ No error in console
- ✅ Dashboard loads
- ℹ️ Sidebar shows "Dashboard" and "Profile" only (until you add permissions)

---

## ❌ **If You Still See Errors**

1. Close ALL browser tabs with the app
2. Clear browser cache again
3. Try in **Incognito/Private mode**
4. Check that dev server restarted successfully

---

## 📝 **Why This Is Necessary**

- Vite's hot reload doesn't always catch all changes
- Your browser cached the old JavaScript
- The old code has the bug
- A full restart loads the fixed code

---

## 🎯 **Quick Commands**

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl + C), then:
yarn dev

# In browser:
Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear cache
Ctrl + Shift + R → Hard refresh
```

**DO THIS NOW** before trying to login again! 🚀
