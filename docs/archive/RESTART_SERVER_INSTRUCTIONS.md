# 🔄 How to Apply the Role-Based Login Changes

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Changes Won't Work Until Server Restart**

The code changes have been made, but they won't take effect until you restart the development server.

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

### **Step 1: Stop Current Server**

In the terminal where `yarn dev` is running:
```
Press: Ctrl + C
```

Wait for the server to fully stop.

### **Step 2: Start Server Again**

```bash
yarn dev
```

### **Step 3: Clear Browser Cache (Important!)**

The browser might be caching the old JavaScript code:

**Option A: Hard Refresh**
```
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

**Option B: Clear Cache**
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Click "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

**Option C: Incognito Mode**
```
Test in a new incognito/private window
```

### **Step 4: Test Login**

Try logging in with: `elisasaychitoleko2@gmail.com`

**Expected Result:**
- ❌ Login should be blocked
- Message: "Your account is awaiting role assignment by an administrator."
- User is immediately signed out

---

## 🔍 **Verify Changes Are Working:**

### **Check Browser Console:**

Open DevTools (F12) and check console when logging in. You should see:
```
🔄 AuthContext: Fetching user profile...
📋 AuthContext: Profile data: {status: "pending", roleId: null, ...}
```

If you DON'T see these messages, the old code is still running.

### **Check What Code is Running:**

1. Open: http://localhost:5174 (or your dev server port)
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to "Sources" tab
4. Find: `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
5. Look at line 78, it should say:
   ```javascript
   if (!profile || !profile.roleId || profile.status === 'pending' || profile.status === 'rejected') {
   ```

If this line is different or missing, the old code is cached.

---

## 🛠️ **If Still Not Working:**

### **Nuclear Option - Complete Restart:**

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)

# Clear all caches
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf dist

# Restart server
yarn dev
```

Then hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

---

## ✅ **Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] Dev server restarted
- [ ] Browser cache cleared (hard refresh)
- [ ] Tested in incognito mode
- [ ] User with `status: "pending"` and `roleId: null` cannot login
- [ ] Error message shows: "Your account is awaiting role assignment"

---

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix:**

### **User: elisasaychitoleko2@gmail.com**
- **Status**: `pending`
- **Role**: `null`
- **Result**: ❌ **Cannot login**
- **Message**: "Your account is awaiting role assignment by an administrator."

### **To Allow This User to Login:**

Update in Firestore:
```
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/fam-rent-sys/firestore/data/users
2. Find user: elisasaychitoleko2@gmail.com
3. Update fields:
   - status: "active"
   - roleId: "some-role-id" (create a role first)
   - organizationId: "your-org-id"
4. Save
5. User can now login ✅
```

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

If the user can still login after:
1. ✅ Server restart
2. ✅ Browser cache clear
3. ✅ Testing in incognito

Then there might be another issue. Let me know and I'll investigate further!
