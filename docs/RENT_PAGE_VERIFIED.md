# ✅ Rent Page - Firebase Integration Verified & Enhanced

## 🎯 Status: WORKING

The Rent page is now fully integrated with Firebase and enhanced with better debugging and error handling.

---

## 🔧 What Was Done

### **1. Verified Firebase Integration** ✅

The RentPage was already using Firebase services:
- ✅ `propertyService` for property data
- ✅ `rentService` for rent records
- ✅ `paymentService` for payment data

### **2. Enhanced Authentication Handling** ✅

**Before:**
```javascript
const { userId, userRole, organizationId } = useAuth();

// Queries enabled with !!userId
enabled: !!userId
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { user, userId, userRole, organizationId } = useAuth();

// Queries enabled with !!user (more reliable)
enabled: !!user

// Uses user?.uid in queries for consistency
propertyService.getAll(user?.uid, userRole, organizationId)
```

**Why this matters:**
- `user` object is more reliable than derived `userId`
- Prevents race conditions during authentication
- Consistent with PropertiesPage and SpaceAssignmentPage

---

### **3. Added Comprehensive Debug Logging** ✅

Added detailed console logs to track data flow:

```javascript
// On mount
console.log('💰 RentPage mounted');
console.log('👤 Auth Context:', { 
  userId: user?.uid, 
  userRole, 
  organizationId,
  hasUser: !!user,
  hasUserId: !!userId,
  hasUserRole: !!userRole,
  hasOrganizationId: !!organizationId
});

// For each query
console.log('🔄 Fetching properties for rent page:', { userId: user?.uid, userRole, organizationId });
console.log('✅ Properties loaded:', data?.length || 0);
console.log('❌ Error fetching properties:', err);

// Similar logs for rent records and payments
```

---

### **4. Updated Query Keys** ✅

Changed from simple string keys to composite keys for better cache management:

**Before:**
```javascript
useQuery('rent', () => rentService.getAll(...))
useQuery('payments', () => paymentService.getAll(...))
```

**After:**
```javascript
useQuery(['rent', user?.uid, userRole, organizationId], () => rentService.getAll(...))
useQuery(['payments', user?.uid, userRole, organizationId], () => paymentService.getAll(...))
useQuery(['rent-properties', user?.uid, userRole, organizationId], () => propertyService.getAll(...))
```

**Benefits:**
- Separate caches for different users
- Automatic cache invalidation when user/role/org changes
- Better debugging in React Query DevTools

---

### **5. Enhanced Payment Creation** ✅

Added logging and proper cache invalidation:

```javascript
const createPaymentMutation = useMutation(
  (paymentData) => {
    console.log('💳 Creating payment:', paymentData);
    return paymentService.create(paymentData, user?.uid, userRole, organizationId);
  },
  {
    onSuccess: (newPayment) => {
      console.log('✅ Payment created successfully:', newPayment);
      // Invalidate specific caches
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['payments', user?.uid, userRole, organizationId]);
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['rent', user?.uid, userRole, organizationId]);
      // ... rest of success handling
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error('❌ Failed to create payment:', error);
      toast.error(`Failed to record payment: ${error.message}`);
    },
  }
);
```

## 🎯 How to Verify It's Working

### **Step 1: Open Rent Page**
Navigate to: http://localhost:5174/app/rent

### **Step 2: Open Browser Console** (F12)
Look for these logs:

```
💰 RentPage mounted
👤 Auth Context: { userId: "...", userRole: "...", organizationId: "...", hasUser: true, ... }
🔄 Fetching properties for rent page: { userId: "...", userRole: "...", organizationId: "..." }
🔄 Fetching rent records: { userId: "...", userRole: "...", organizationId: "..." }
🔄 Fetching payments: { userId: "...", userRole: "...", organizationId: "..." }
✅ Properties loaded: 2
✅ Rent records loaded: 0
✅ Payments loaded: 0
```

### **Step 3: Check Statistics**
You should see real data from database:
- Property count from your database
- Rent records count
- Payment totals
- Collection rate calculations

### **Step 4: Check Tabs**
- **Rent Agreements Tab**: Shows rent records (0 if none exist yet)
- **Payment History Tab**: Shows payments (0 if none exist yet)
- **Overdue Payments Tab**: Shows overdue items (0 if none)

## 📊 Database Collections Used

| Collection | Purpose | Fetched By |
|------------|---------|------------|
| `properties` | Property list | `propertyService.getAll()` |
| `rent` | Rent agreements | `rentService.getAll()` |
| `payments` | Payment records | `paymentService.getAll()` |

### **Org Admin:**
- Sees properties, rent records, and payments in their organization

### **Property Manager:**
- Sees properties in their organization
- Sees rent records for their properties
- Can create rent agreements and record payments

### **Financial Viewer:**
- Read-only access to properties, rent, and payments in their organization

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **No Data Showing:**

**Check Console Logs:**
```
💰 RentPage mounted
👤 Auth Context: { ... }
```

If `hasUser: false` or `hasUserRole: false`:
- You're not logged in properly
- Refresh page or re-login

If queries return 0 results:
- Check your database has rent records
- Verify your `organizationId` matches records in database
- Try logging in as super admin to see all data

### **Queries Not Running:**

**Check Console for:**
```
🔄 Fetching properties for rent page: ...
🔄 Fetching rent records: ...
```

If you don't see these logs:
- `user` object is undefined
- Queries are not enabled
- Check AuthContext is working

### **Create Test Rent Record:**

Use the "Assign New Tenant" flow:
1. Go to Rent page
2. Click "Assign New Tenant"
3. Select a property
4. Assign a tenant to a space
5. Return to Rent page - record should appear
