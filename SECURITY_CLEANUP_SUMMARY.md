# Security Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed (Sensitive Data)

The following files contained sensitive credentials, test account information, or API keys and have been permanently deleted:

### Deleted Files:
1. ✅ `docs/CORRECT_TEST_CREDENTIALS.md` - Test account credentials with passwords
2. ✅ `docs/TEST_ACCOUNTS_CREDENTIALS.md` - Complete test account database
3. ✅ `docs/env_content.txt` - Firebase private keys and configuration
4. ✅ `docs/archive/noe.txt` - Admin credentials
5. ✅ `docs/VERCEL_ENV_QUICK_FIX.txt` - Firebase API keys
6. ✅ `docs/archive/ADD_TO_VERCEL_NOW.txt` - Deployment credentials
7. ✅ `docs/CUSTOM_CLAIMS_SETUP.md` - Test credentials
8. ✅ `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Test accounts
9. ✅ `docs/MANUAL_ADD_PERMISSIONS.md` - Credential examples
10. ✅ `docs/MANUAL_ROLE_ASSIGNMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Test credentials
11. ✅ `docs/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` - Credential examples
12. ✅ `docs/README_SIDEBAR.md` - Test account info
13. ✅ `docs/ROLE_BASED_AUTH_FLOW.md` - Credential references
14. ✅ `docs/SIDEBAR_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Test credentials
15. ✅ `docs/PAGE_ACCESS_BY_ROLE.md` - Sensitive references

### Sensitive Data Removed:
- ❌ Test account emails: `superadmin@propertytest.com`, `admin@propertytest.com`, etc.
- ❌ Test passwords: `SuperAdmin123!`, `TestAdmin123!`, `Manager123!`, `Finance123!`
- ❌ Firebase private keys (full keys with BEGIN/END markers)
- ❌ Firebase project IDs and service account emails
- ❌ API keys and configuration secrets

## What Remains Safe

The following documentation remains as it contains only architectural/design information without credentials:

### Safe to Keep:
- ✅ `docs/RBAC_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - System architecture (no credentials)
- ✅ `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Code organization
- ✅ `docs/AUTH_FLOW_EXPLANATION.md` - Authentication flow (no secrets)
- ✅ `docs/CONTENT_INDEX.md` - Documentation index
- ✅ Feature documentation (payment receipts, properties, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. **Review remaining files** in `docs/` for any lingering sensitive data
2. **Update `.gitignore`** to exclude sensitive files
3. **Consider adding** a `.env.example` file with placeholder values
4. **Audit git history** to ensure sensitive data wasn't committed to version control

## Important

⚠️ If any of these deleted files were previously committed to git:
- Credentials may exist in git history
- Consider running `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove sensitive data from history
- If sensitive data was pushed to a public repository, consider the credentials compromised and change them immediately

## Recommendation

For production deployments, use:
- Environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Separate development and production credentials
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use secrets management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
